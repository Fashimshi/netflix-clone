# Recommendation-System-Netflix-CLone-

Welcome to the Recommendation-System-Netflix-Clone GitHub repository. This repository contains the code for a recommendation system that is similar to the one used by Netflix.

The recommendation system uses a combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to make personalized recommendations to users. It takes into account the ratings and reviews that users have given to different movies, as well as the metadata associated with each movie (such as its genre, director, and cast).


To use the recommendation system, simply clone this repository and run the code on your local machine. You will need to have Python and the required libraries installed in order to run the code. The code is well-documented, so you should be able to understand how it works even if you are not an expert in recommendation systems.

I hope that this recommendation system will be useful to anyone who is interested in building their own personalized recommendation system. I welcome any feedback or suggestions that you may have. Thank you for using the platform!
